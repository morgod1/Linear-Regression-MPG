# Packages needed

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib

# Running the code

Once the packages specified above haven been installed, the code should be able to run. 

# The result

Running the code will generate an output in the terminal which specifies the features used, and their relative importance. It will also provide the R2 value for the training data and testing data respectively.

In addition, three graphs will be generated in program folder once the code is ran. A dot plot denoting the actual vs predicted mpg, a correlation matrix of all the features, and finally a bar chart showing the relative importance of the features used.
